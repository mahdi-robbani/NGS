Analysis Description
--------------------
MEME (Mixed Effects Model of Evolution) estimates a site-wise synonymous
(&alpha;) and a two-category mixture of non-synonymous (&beta;-, with
proportion p-, and &beta;+ with proportion [1-p-]) rates, and uses a
likelihood ratio test to determine if &beta;+ > &alpha; at a site. The
estimates aggregate information over a proportion of branches at a site,
so the signal is derived from episodic diversification, which is a
combination of strength of selection [effect size] and the proportion of
the tree affected. A subset of branches can be selected for testing as
well, in which case an additional (nuisance) parameter will be inferred
-- the non-synonymous rate on branches NOT selected for testing.
Multiple partitions within a NEXUS file are also supported for
recombination - aware analysis.

### Branches to include in the MEME analysis
Selected 7 branches to include in the MEME analysis: `Obp76b, Obp19a, Obp56g, Obp56f, Node4, Obp56h, Node3`


### Obtaining branch lengths and nucleotide substitution biases under the nucleotide GTR model
* Log(L) = -2615.50, AIC-c =  5261.18 (15 estimated parameters)

### Obtaining the global omega estimate based on relative GTR branch lengths and nucleotide substitution biases
* Log(L) = -2511.65, AIC-c =  5068.49 (22 estimated parameters)
* non-synonymous/synonymous rate ratio for *test* =   0.2739

### Improving branch lengths, nucleotide substitution biases, and global dN/dS ratios under a full codon model
