[2017-04-11 15:45:42.072] [jointLog] [info] Computed 24840 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2017-04-11 15:45:42.072] [jointLog] [info] Counted 4503025 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2017-04-11 15:45:42.079] [jointLog] [warning] Only 4503025 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
