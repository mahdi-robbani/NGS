[2017-04-11 14:32:47.555] [jointLog] [info] Computed 24127 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2017-04-11 14:32:47.556] [jointLog] [info] Counted 3381046 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2017-04-11 14:32:47.562] [jointLog] [warning] Only 3381046 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
