[2017-04-11 16:19:49.770] [jointLog] [info] Computed 22284 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2017-04-11 16:19:49.770] [jointLog] [info] Counted 4060783 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2017-04-11 16:19:49.777] [jointLog] [warning] Only 4060783 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
