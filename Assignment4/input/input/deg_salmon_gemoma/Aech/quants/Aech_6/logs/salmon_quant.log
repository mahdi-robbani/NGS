[2017-04-11 15:58:51.300] [jointLog] [info] Computed 24205 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2017-04-11 15:58:51.300] [jointLog] [info] Counted 3232007 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2017-04-11 15:58:51.307] [jointLog] [warning] Only 3232007 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
