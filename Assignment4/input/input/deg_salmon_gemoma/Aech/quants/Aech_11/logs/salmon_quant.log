[2017-04-11 14:26:06.895] [jointLog] [info] Computed 24952 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2017-04-11 14:26:06.895] [jointLog] [info] Counted 4605335 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2017-04-11 14:26:06.902] [jointLog] [warning] Only 4605335 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
