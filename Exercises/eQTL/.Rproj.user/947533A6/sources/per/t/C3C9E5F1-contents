# Understanding the data

## Task 1
1. In the `sub_geno.tab` file, 0, 1 and 2 most likely represent the two homozygous and hgeteroguzous genotypes. -1 probably means missing data.
2. In the `sub_expr.tab` file, the rows are genes/transcripts and the columns are different samples and their gene expression values.
3. The `design.tab` file contains information about each column of the `sub_expr.tab` file. It says which population they belong to and other characteristics.

## Task 2
1. Calculate the number of missing genotypes for each SNP across all individuals.
```{r}
snps <- read.table("sub_geno.tab")
missing_count <- apply((snps == -1), 1, sum)
head(missing_count)
```

2. Calculate the minor allele frequency (MAF) for all SNPs across all individuals.
```{r}
get_geno_frequency <- function(geno, snp_mat){
  boolean_matrix <- snp_mat == geno
  count <- apply(boolean_matrix, 1, sum)
  freq <- count/dim(snps)[2]
  return (freq)
}

get_maf <- function(snp_mat){
  genotypes <- c(0,1,2)
  #get matrix of genotype frequencies
  geno_freq <- sapply(genotypes, get_geno_frequency, snp_mat)
  colnames(geno_freq) <- genotypes
  allele_freq <- geno_freq + geno_freq[,2]/2
  allele_freq <- allele_freq[,-2]
  maf <- apply(allele_freq, 1, min)
  return (maf)
}

maf <- get_maf(snps)
head(maf)
```

3. Filter our SNPs that have missing genotypes or a MAF<0.05 and use the filtered snps for the rest of the exercise.
```{r}
keep <- maf >= 0.05 & missing_count == 0
snps_filtered <- snps[keep,]
dim(snps_filtered)
```

4. Calculate the MAF for africans and non-africans separately. Is there a difference?
```{r}
design <- read.table("design.tab", header = T, sep = "\t")

filter_snp_population <- function(pop, snp_mat, design_mat, inv=F){
  if(inv){
    cols <- design_mat$Source.Name[design_mat$Characteristics.population. != pop]
  } else{
    cols <- design_mat$Source.Name[design_mat$Characteristics.population. == pop]
  }
  snp_mat <- (snp_mat[, cols])
  return(snp_mat)
}

african_snps <- filter_snp_population("YRI", snps_filtered, design)
non_african_snps <- filter_snp_population("YRI", snps_filtered, design, inv = T)

african_maf <- get_maf(african_snps)
non_african_maf <- get_maf(non_african_snps)
print("African")
print(head(african_maf))
print("Non-African")
print(head(non_african_maf))
```

Yes, there is a difference between the two groups.

## Task 3
1. Plot the distribution of expression levels across all samples for the ENSG00000172404.4 gene.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
gene_expr <- read.table("sub_expr.tab")
head(gene_expr)
gene1 <- c("ENSG00000172404.4")
gene_expr %>%
  t %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  #rownames_to_column("Gene") %>%
  select(ENSG00000172404.4) %>%
  #select(-Gene) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=ENSG00000172404.4)) + geom_histogram()

hist(as.matrix(gene_expr[gene1,]))

```

2. Plot the expression levels of ENSG00000172404.4 against the genotypes of snp_22_41256802 and
snp_22_45782142
```{r}

```
