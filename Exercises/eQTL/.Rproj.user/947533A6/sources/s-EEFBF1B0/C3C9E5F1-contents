# Understanding the data

## Task 1
1. In the `sub_geno.tab` file, 0, 1 and 2 most likely represent the two homozygous and hgeteroguzous genotypes. -1 probably means missing data.
2. In the `sub_expr.tab` file, the rows are genes/transcripts and the columns are different samples and their gene expression values.
3. The `design.tab` file contains information about each column of the `sub_expr.tab` file. It says which population they belong to and other characteristics.

## Task 2
1. Calculate the number of missing genotypes for each SNP across all individuals.
```{r}
snps <- read.table("sub_geno.tab")
missing_count <- apply((snps == -1), 1, sum)
head(missing_count)
```

2. Calculate the minor allele frequency (MAF) for all SNPs across all individuals.
```{r}
get_geno_frequency <- function(geno, snp_mat){
  boolean_matrix <- snp_mat == geno
  count <- apply(boolean_matrix, 1, sum)
  freq <- count/dim(snps)[2]
  return (freq)
}

get_maf <- function(snp_mat){
  genotypes <- c(0,1,2)
  #get matrix of genotype frequencies
  geno_freq <- sapply(genotypes, get_geno_frequency, snp_mat)
  colnames(geno_freq) <- genotypes
  allele_freq <- geno_freq + geno_freq[,2]/2
  allele_freq <- allele_freq[,-2]
  maf <- apply(allele_freq, 1, min)
  return (maf)
}

maf <- get_maf(snps)
```

3. Filter our SNPs that have missing genotypes or a MAF<0.05 and use the filtered snps for the rest of the exercise.
```{r}
filter <- maf <0.05 | missing_count > 0
snps_filtered <- snps[filter,]
dim(snps_filtered)
```

4. Calculate the MAF for africans and non-africans separately. Is there a difference?
```{r}

```
