# Part 1

## Question 1
In the `sub_geno.tab` file, 0, 1 and 2 most likely represent the two homozygous and hgeteroguzous genotypes. -1 probably means missing data.

## Question 2
The `design.tab` file contains information about each column of the `sub_expr.tab` file. It says which population they belong to and other characteristics.

## Question 3
Gene expression levels can be explained by the first SNP but not the second. This is because the first SNP has a very small p value for its coefficient meaning the the relationship did not occur by chance. In contrast the second SNP has a high P value so it most likely occured by chance.

## Question 4 Do a linear regression for snp_22_43336231 on ENSG00000100266.11
### Without covariates
```{r}
