## Task 1
1383 unique barcodes are found.  
1104 unique protein sequences are found.  
The most common sequence:

## Task 2
-Are the deviations you observe beyond what you expect based on the experimental error? Submit plot and discussion as part of your hand-in.
Scatterplot + discussion

-Submit the plots for all 4 distributions as part of your handin
AA1 and AA2 - do they differ? What would you expect based on biochemistry vs. what do you observe?
- for synonymous mutations?
- for missense mutations?

## Task 3

Submit a plot of the matrix (see e.g. ex. 3) as part of your homework assignment.

## Task 4
### 4.1
They both have an alignment near the end of the sequence. The DNA sequence however some mismatches although when translated to protein, the sequences align perfectly. This is due to the redundancy of the genetic code which allows different codons to code for the same amino acid.

### 4.2
249 variants are found in both datasets
721 variants are found in the Sarkisyan dataset
525 variants are found in the dataset we used in class

### 4.3
Scatterplot + discussion
